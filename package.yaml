synopsis: An experimental document database for org-mode files
description: |
  zation is an experiment based on an idea to make a document database for
  org-mode. The idea is that it's something like MongoDB but for org-mode files
  instead of JSON. Please take a look at the README.org file to get a more
  detailed explaination of the reasons, goals, and a roadmap of the project, but
  the TL;DR is I want to have a SQLite-like database for my org files that will
  have all the same features that org-mode has and much more.
